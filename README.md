# PerceptShade: A Hierarchical Reasoning AI System for Precision Dental Shade Matching Across Clinical Lighting Conditions

This repository hosts the official implementation for the paper:

**“A Hierarchical Reasoning AI System for Precision Dental Shade Matching Across Clinical Lighting Conditions”**

The code includes the core modules described in the manuscript, such as:
- Stable perception and highlight suppression components  
- Hierarchical luminance–chromaticity projection  
- Perceptual consistency optimization  
- Inference pipeline for shade recommendation  

## Code Availability
In accordance with journal policies, the full source code will be released **after the acceptance and formal publication** of the paper.  
This ensures a stable and reproducible version aligned with the final, peer-reviewed work.

## Data Availability
The dataset used in this study consists of clinical intraoral images collected from patients.  
Due to privacy regulations and institutional restrictions, **the raw clinical data cannot be publicly released**.  
We will provide detailed preprocessing descriptions and annotation protocols in the supplementary materials to support reproducibility.
